                            After making multiple layers by accident, oopsie. 
                            We tricked it into skipping a layer and just printing it normally. 
                            I need to be very careful with the software. 
                            It was a waste of time if I didn’t catch it first, but now it looks cool. 
                            Yipee.

                            It looks so nice. 
                            It works with a lot of details, as it is the one being tested with most of the printers, so it is only natural that it worked out as well as it did.

                            After making sure I had the right (left) controller, I needed to choose a stabilizer because it couldn’t stay flat on the printing sheet. 
                            It seems like the Organic is easiest to remove, but that’s to be seen. 
                            Calibrating the printer wasn’t too hard, nor was a change necessary for the nozzle elevation level. 
                            So like, hopefully it prints well.
                            After it printed I realized there must've been a better angle to print it on, because the legs of the controller were a pain in the ass to clean off. 
                            Maybe I’ll do it again a different day or layer it over with something different to make it come comfortable.

                            Splicing and stitching shapes together to create larger, more complex creations is fun and a great brain teaser.
                            Especially the simple User Interface. While the selection of shapes might be limiting, that is part of the creation process. 
                            Making more shapes out of other shapes is part of how the program's limitations breed endless possibilities.

                            After searching for a good ten minutes for a project I’d like to remix in Tinkercad and Fusion, I found a DS stand. 
                            It props a DS lite on the bottom half and leans it against a support bar that also has prongs to hold the charging cord in place. 
                            It also has a place for the actual charger, as well as slots for some DS games. 
                            The only problem is I don’t have a DS lite.
                            So I decided to modify it for my New Nintendo 3ds XL, which involves making everything larger. 
                            First I looked up measurements for both the DS lite and N3DSXL, and figured out the ratios to increase the length and width of the base, title and notches that would hold the 3ds. 
                            But before that I got distracted by trying to cover up the DS logo and replace it with the 3ds logo. 
                            That was really difficult. 
                            I do not remember why. 
                            I think I was making the 3ds logo based on the parts of the DS logo, and then adding a 3D model of the 3 on that specific font.
                            I then needed to hollow out the charger section, as it was not the same charger. 
                            So I looked up dimensions and made a hollowing box and made space for it in the old charger box. 
                            But after seeing some comments on the forum about it being too big for the Prusa Mini, I decided to separate the charger box from the main build to decrease its length. 
                            And then I realized I needed to slice some of the logo, which wasn’t easy and butchered the logo and made me sad. Oh well.
                            I printed it and found some problems. 
                            The ridges carrying the 3ds still needed to be expanded, and the charging port was not large enough. 
                            These were the main focuses I would take to Fusion.

                            Before I started using Fusion, I split apart the design to its main components in Tinkercad: The Front, The Base, The Left and Right Ridge Stands, The Two Support Prongs that Hold the Charger Cord, and the Charger Box (now with more space inside). 
                            So after sending them all individually into Fusion, it took an embarrassingly long amount of time to not only get them all in, but put them all in the same file and unlink each piece so they can be edited. 
                            At that point there were some auto recommendations the software provided to fill up unnecessary holes and simplify the general structure. 
                            Sadly, I was unable to fix the logo, but each aspect of the creation was made a little larger in the slicing and editing process.
                            I also decided for my sanity to make each piece of the print flat on the board, so I can put it together when it’s done, as by adding the human touch of physical assembly, it’s almost like I am taking part in a third interface for remixing: Reality.

                            I found some obvious mistakes in my creation, as the grooves that were supposed to hold the 3ds also printed the square of the base under the grooves, so now there’s extra space in between the front, the base, and the grooves. 
                            But this was actually a boon, as the grooves aren’t deep enough. So the extra space between the grooves and the base can be used to support the device.
                            I also hot glued all this stuff together. 
                            That was fun. Tactile construction is a lot more enjoyable than the digital make-up of the software. 
                            Also, if I didn’t print it out in pieces, I wouldn't be able to have improved the design last second. 
                            Overall, reality is the best interface, because it’s what you make of it.

Starting this project meant working in pairs, so I had to make sure to trust my partner. While we both took turns using the solder, as we both wanted experience practicing, it was of the utmost importance to keep our setup organized, unless we would cross paths and damage the radio with the hot solder, or worse, each other. </div>

                            Getting the pieces to solder to the board was difficult sometimes, and when we finished in multiple sessions, it still didn't work. 
                            Probably an issue with how we constructed it as we had a pretty large nozzle. 
                            But we kept our production organized, despite the difficulties with the soldering.

                            Afterwards, my project partner Steven Nasar and I took measurements of every dimension and protrusion of the radio. That being the buttons, the knob, the radio antenna, the speaker, and the battery, as to make a case for it. That took a while and we did need to take new measurements whenever things didn’t match up. All of it was a constant process of design and redesign.

                            Using Tinkercad to do the modeling for the 3D print and the 2D cut, we used the literal one for one measurements and positions of the board, and expanded it for the model to make space for it, as it will not be exact. The inaccuracies of 3D printing need to be accounted for.
                            Not only that, but laser cutting will need to be done in hopes of having a completed project. That involves making the container for the radio piece by piece. First it was a box, and then it will have groves. Yippee. I am tired.

                            First it was a shell that didn’t need to make room for the radio to be inserted in, but rather to be built around the radio. I made this piece by piece, alienating each side of the radio shell model, as to keep the measurements flat. It’s fun! We made it again, but with grooves. They didn't stay in, oh well!

                            This stuff took forever because of the holidays, as such we did not have the same amount of time to work on it outside the classroom as expected. When time contraints are planned out for the majority but cannot be worked around by the minority, it requires enginuity not only in hoow to design time, but make a design faster to save it as well. Both me and my partner took time in between moments of stress and overcomplicated schedules to work on the project, but despite that, it lacks all the polish four weeks of work would imply, with the asterisk that it was more like two and a half.

                            This project had multiple options that involved familiarizing yourself with the CAD software of choice to either:
                            a. Create a replacement object.
                            b. Modify an item based on accessibility and disability.
                            c. Make something functional for the engineering lab.
                            I decided to do the first option, as my idea for the third wasn’t that much of an issue, apparently. 
                            While the decision to start something new was alluring, that was a time waster. 
                            I decided to return to the replacement Wii stand and upload it to Printables.

                            I pushed myself to remake an already existing model of a Wii Stand using my primitive Fusion 360 skills. 
                            After importing the model from Printables; a public 3D model repository website, I made sure to draw sketches on the faces to copy the general measurements. 
                            I was going to split the model in two to more easily print it on the smaller printers. 
                            There would've been holes and poles to fit each part into, but that would make it much easier to break.

                            <div class="flex-shrink-0"> <span class="text-primary">Mid October 2025 </span></div>
                            The split model was supposed to be for the smaller printer, but I was able to learn how to use the Raise3D printer to keep the model large, which was great because now I was making sure that the 3D model was merely based on the existing public model; I could now make something from ‘scratch.’
                            <div class="row">

                            <div class="subheading mb-3"> It looks soooooooo coooool</div>

                            Finally, after 10 hours of printing, the model is here…aaaand the mistakes are already obvious.
                            While making the model, the outside ended up getting the inner parts curve, and the inside was sharp and angular. 
                            But otherwise it holds the Wii up nicely. 
                            This was a faster project that helped me be confident in my own fast-prototyping skills. 
                            It definitely helped me be confident in my own abilities, and I hope this can take me into the final project.
